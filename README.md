# Car Safety

## Purpose 

#### The purpose of this app was to make it easier for people to search and compare safety information about vehicles. The app gathers data from the NHTSA and from IIHS and shows all crash test information and ratings from both organizations. It also lists all open recalls for the car. Easily compare up to 3 different vehicles directly to ensure you have the most pertinent information when making your final choice.


## How it Works

#### The app allows a user to search for a vehicle if it is the NHTSA database, it then cross-references that vehicle and finds it within the IIHS database. If both organizations have tested the vehicle, the app provides the NHTSA crash test ratings, the IIHS crash test ratings, and all recorded recalls associated with the vehicle.
