# Car Safety

## Purpose 

##### The purpose of this app was to make it easier for people to search and compare safety information about vehicles. The app gathers data from the NHTSA and from IIHS and shows all crash test information and ratings from both organizations. It also lists all open recalls for the car. Easily compare up to 3 different vehicles directly to ensure you have the most pertinent information when making your final choice.


## How it Works

#####  The app allows a user to search for a vehicle if it is the NHTSA database, it then cross-references that vehicle and finds it within the IIHS database. If both organizations have tested the vehicle, the app provides the NHTSA crash test ratings, the IIHS crash test ratings, and all recorded recalls associated with the vehicle.


## User Navigation

##### Start off by reading and accepting the waiver on the main page. This is to inform the user that the website is not liable for the information provided and that the information is not to be taken at face value.

##### Next the user can begin by viewing the top safety pick+ cars on the home page. Simply click one to view more information about it. If not, the user can click on the search link in the header and search for a car based on model year, make, model and trim. 

##### View the information side by side from the NHTSA and the IIHS as well as active recalls at the bottom of the page. If you would like to add the car to the comparison table, click the add to compare button. 

##### The comparison page shows the first three cars that were added to it. If you add more than three cars, the latest ones will not be shown until you remove other cars from the list. The comparison page allows you to easily compare up to three cars side by side. If you would like to see the car's full details in the view page, simply click the car's link and it will take you there.


## Technologies Used

##### This website used React to render the information to the screen. It is a single page application that also uses react router to allow the user to go back and forth as necessary. The website makes API calls to the backend server which gathers the data from the various third party sites and parses it for the front end application. 


## About the Project


##### The project was created to learn more about third party API calls and integrating them into a full stack app. This is an ongoing project to further optimize and clean up the user experience.
